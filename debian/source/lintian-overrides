# Playwright packages are development dependencies used only for browser
# testing in the upstream project. They are not used in the CLI binary
# and their NOTICE files are not relevant to the distributed package.
# The NOTICE files exist in the source tree but are not installed in the
# binary package, which is intentional since playwright is not used at runtime.
